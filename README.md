# My [resume](#My) and portfolio
```
It is actually quite dificult for me to create a portfolio that demonstrates what I can do.  For one thing, everyone makes me sign an NDA which, to my understanding, prevents me from putting code that I write for them online. Also, most of the code I worked  on dealt with internal customer or admin or business process specifically secured against general the general public and hackers. And finally, I have been programming and geeking on computers since 1992, and the days of paschal in high school. As a computer engineer major at Georgia Tech I learned how-to and actually designed and implemented a pipelined computer processor and memory chip down to the level of ones and zeros of transistors and gates.  If given the appropriate resources and testing environment, there is nothing I can't do or learn how to do when it comes to languages or getting two or more systems to communicate in an organized and expected way.  I can provide prototyping of new technologies quickly with an infrastucture in place for detailed design documentation and scripted automated end-to-end testing.   I can work smoothly with a team across different timezones or alone.  Just tell me what you want done, and I will figure it out.
```
Below is a table (that's right, working on my [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) skills) of technologies that I dabble with for fun to stay up-to-date with the breadth of current technologies.  
```
As an interesting side note, my love and skill with computer languages extends from the computer world to the linguistic and musical world as well.  When I'm not geeking out, I try to keep my portuguese, and japanese, alive while re-learning spanish. I also know how to read music and I play the piano, flute, sax, berimbau, and bass guitar (with varying degrees of mastery).

This is my current(Jan 22, 2018) entry point to my new portfolio.  From here you will be directed to code examples, samples, and demos in various frontend and backend libraries and frameworks. I decided to start out with Vuejs and React but I will add examples and demos with GoLang, Django, Java, threejs, Selenium, D3, and native and hybrid mobile apps.

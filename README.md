# My Portfolio

>####  I have been programming and geeking on computers since 1992, and the days of paschal in high school. As a computer engineer major at Georgia Tech I learned how-to and actually designed and implemented a pipelined computer processor and memory chip down to the level of ones and zeros of transistors and logic gates with [VHDL](https://www.nandland.com/vhdl/tutorials/tutorial-introduction-to-vhdl-for-beginners.html) and simulation in C.    If given the appropriate resources and testing environment, there is nothing I can't do or learn how to do when it comes to languages or getting two or more systems to communicate in an organized and expected way.  I can provide prototyping of new technologies quickly with an infrastucture in place for detailed design documentation and scripted automated end-to-end testing.   I can also work smoothly with a team across different timezones or alone. I can geek on anything; I can learn anything.

>#### As an interesting side note, my love and skill with computer languages extends from the computer world to the linguistic and musical world as well.  When I'm not geeking out on the computer, I try to keep my portuguese, and japanese, alive while re-learning spanish. I also know how to read music and play the piano, flute, sax, [berimbau](http://www.capoeira-world.com/capoeira-music/capoeira-instruments/berimbau/), and bass guitar (all with varying degrees of mastery).  

**Below is a table (that's right, working on my [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) skills) of scripts and applications in various levels of development and often with different areas of focus(i.e. documentation, testing, mobile development, databases, front or backend technologies...). I decided to start out with Vuejs and React but I will add examples and demos with GoLang, Django, Java, threejs, Selenium, D3, and native and hybrid mobile apps...**

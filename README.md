# My Portfolio

>#### Below is a table of scripts and applications in various levels of development and often with different areas of focus(i.e. documentation, testing, mobile development, databases, front or backend technologies...). I decided to start out with Vuejs and React but I will add examples and demos with GoLang, Django, Java, threejs, Selenium, D3, and native and hybrid mobile apps...

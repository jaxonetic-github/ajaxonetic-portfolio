# My portfolio

>It is actually quite difficult for me to create a portfolio that demonstrates what I can do.  For one thing, everyone makes me sign an NDA which, to my understanding, prevents me from putting code that I write for them online. Also, most of the code I worked on dealt with internal customer or admin or business process specifically secured against the general public and/or hackers. It's also difficult because I have been programming and geeking on computers since 1992, and the days of paschal in high school. The best I can do is show scripts and applications in various levels of development and often with different areas of focus(i.e. documentation, testing, mobile development, databases, front or backend technologies... ) As a computer engineer major at Georgia Tech I learned how-to and actually designed and implemented a pipelined computer processor and memory chip down to the level of ones and zeros of transistors and logic gates.  If given the appropriate resources and testing environment, there is nothing I can't do or learn how to do when it comes to languages or getting two or more systems to communicate in an organized and expected way.  I can provide prototyping of new technologies quickly with an infrastucture in place for detailed design documentation and scripted automated end-to-end testing.   I can work smoothly with a team across different timezones or alone.

>As an interesting side note, my love and skill with computer languages extends from the computer world to the linguistic and musical world as well.  When I'm not geeking out, I try to keep my portuguese, and japanese, alive while re-learning spanish. I also know how to read music and play the piano, flute, sax, berimbau, and bass guitar (with varying degrees of mastery).

>**Below is a table (that's right, working on my [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) skills) of code examples, samples, and demos in various frontend and backend libraries and frameworks and languages. I decided to start out with Vuejs and React but I will add examples and demos with GoLang, Django, Java, threejs, Selenium, D3, and native and hybrid mobile apps.**

This is the entry point to my new portfolio.  From here you will be directed to code examples, samples, and demos in various technologies. 

For the frontend examples, I will use accounts in Codepen.io or jsfiddle.  After you hire me(wink wink), I will reopen my AWS account to demonstrate backend and cloud admin abilities.
